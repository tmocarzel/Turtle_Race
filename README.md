# Turtle_Race

## Overview
The Turtle Race Game is a simple, interactive Python application that simulates a race between four turtles. Each turtle represents a family member — Dad, Mom, Victor, and Eva — and races towards the finish line. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins the race, and a message is displayed on the screen announcing the winner. This game is built using Python's Turtle Graphics library and is designed to be fun and educational, demonstrating basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and the use of libraries.

## Features
- A graphical race track with a start and finish line.
- Four uniquely colored turtles representing different racers.
- Randomized movement for each turtle, making each race outcome unpredictable.
- A message displayed on the screen announcing the winner.

## Prerequisites
To run this game, you need:
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

## How to Play
- Simply run the script to start the race.
- Watch as the four turtles race towards the finish line.
- The game automatically announces the winner once a turtle crosses the finish line.
- Close the game window to end the game.

## Customization
You can customize the game by editing the source code:
- Change the turtles' names and colors.
- Adjust the speed of the turtles or the distance of the race.
- Add more turtles to the race.
